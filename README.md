# ✈️ Airline Booking System — Fullstack (Spring Boot + React + MySQL)

A comprehensive airline management platform enabling **flight booking, scheduling, and role-based operations** for customers, pilots, and administrators. Includes automated email notifications for user register and booking.    
The backend is built with **Spring Boot** for scalability and security, while the frontend (React) offers an intuitive and responsive interface — all powered by **MySQL** and **JWT authentication**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

### 🧩 Backend — Powered by Spring Boot

**🔹 Database Architecture**  
Designed a relational database in **MySQL** with structured entities for **Users**, **Roles**, **Flights**, **Bookings**, and **Airports**.    
Established **one-to-many** and **many-to-one** relationships to maintain data integrity and ensure efficient lookups for flight and booking datasets.

**🔹 RESTful API Development**  
Developed modular REST endpoints for handling **authentication, user management, bookings, and flight operations**.  
Used a standardized response structure (`Response<T>`) across all endpoints for better API consistency.

**🔹 Security and Authentication**  
Implemented **Spring Security** with **JWT** for stateless authentication.  
Each user is authenticated via token-based and role-based access control restricting access to sensitive endpoints.

**🔹 Role-Based Access Control**  
Three main roles are defined:
- **Customer:** Can search and book flights.
- **Pilot:** Can view assigned flights and update flight status.
- **Admin:** Has full access to manage users, flights, airports, and bookings.

**🔹 Email Notifications**  
Integrated **JavaMailSender** to deliver automated transactional emails, such as:
- Welcome emails after registration
- Booking confirmations

### 🎨 Frontend — Built with React

**🔹 Responsive UI Design**  
Developed a dynamic interface where users can register, search for flights, and manage bookings.  
Admins and pilots access role-based dashboards with tailored functionality.

**🔹 Real-Time Flight Search**  
Integrated API-based flight filtering by **airport**, **status**, **date**, and **time**, allowing customers to easily find available flights.

**🔹 Smooth API Integration**  
Used **Axios** for REST communication with the backend, automatically attaching JWT tokens to authorized requests.

### 📂 Core Components

#### Entities
- `User` → defines user data and assigned roles
- `Role` → defines authorization levels (CUSTOMER, ADMIN, PILOT)
- `Flight` → stores flight info, assigned pilot, and schedule
- `Booking` → links user and flight with booking details
- `Airport` → stores departure and arrival data
- `Passenger` → stores passengers info and links with booking details
- `EmailNotification` → defines email notification setting

#### Controllers
- `AuthController` → handles user registration and login with JWT authentication
- `FlightController` → manages flight creation, updates, status changes, and search operations
- `BookingController` → processes customer bookings and booking retrieval
- `AirportController` → provides endpoints to fetch and manage airport data
- `UserController` → manages user details and roles
- `RoleController` → handles system role retrieval and user-role assignments

#### Security Configuration
- **JWT Authentication Filter** validates tokens on each request for stateless session management
- **Custom Access Handlers** manage authentication and authorization errors with consistent responses
- Role-Based Authorization enforces access control through `@PreAuthorize` and endpoint-specific permissions
- Password Encryption ensures secure storage using BCryptPasswordEncoder
